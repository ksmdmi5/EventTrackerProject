## Event Tracker Project

### Overview
Have ever been the kind and generous that lends out your rake, hose, or $20 to your
friends and neighbors? Well me too, but my problem has been how do I keep track of
who has what or whose items I have borrowed. Well this Borrow Tracker program allows
users to create perform CRUD operations that will allow them to track what they have
borrowed, its value, who from, when, the date it was borrowed and returned, and whether  
the user was the borrower or the lender.


### Technologies Used

* Java
* JPA
* Spring
* MySQL
* AWS
* Atom
* Postman

### Lessons Learned
The main purpose of this project is more reps with learning full stack development
using different methods. The bigs ones this time are using @Service, JPA Repository,
and Postman to test the connections. I will admit they were a major time saver in
reducing the amount of code that any program that has CRUD functionality requires.
